# javaMethods
This project is a combination of class follow through of the Udemy Course: Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers
https://examsoft.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/learn/lecture/10215708#overview
and a coding challenge within this lesson. 

The challenge was to create two methods one to display where a particular player would place on the score table based on several name and score input.
The first method created the string that would be output with the variable for the player's name and where they placed on the score table. 

The second method was a conditional statement to calculate what the placement would be based on pre-defined score ranges. 

The final output defined the score and player named variables to pass to the methods and then an output statement was generated. 

The instructor solution, also included in the file but commented out, did not return anything for the first function and hard coded the names. My solution 
created a variable for the name that was set each time. The instructor solution is more concise, however since mine creates a variable for the name, 
it can be built out to take in information from the front end, or another source, to pass to the method. So while it is a a bit more lengthy, my solution
can be more conducive to a situation where the data won't be entered directly but rather passed from a text box on the front end or perhaps a database.
